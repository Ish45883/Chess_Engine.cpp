Minimax Search Algorithm (Core Logic):

Below is a simplified version of the brute-force Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning used in the engineâ€™s move evaluation:


    def minimax(position, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    if depth == 0 or game_over(position):
        return evaluate(position)

    if maximizing_player:
        max_eval = float('-inf')
        for move in generate_legal_moves(position):
            eval = minimax(make_move(position, move), depth - 1, alpha, beta, False)
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # beta cutoff
        return max_eval
    else:
        min_eval = float('inf')
        for move in generate_legal_moves(position):
            eval = minimax(make_move(position, move), depth - 1, alpha, beta, True)
            min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
            beta = min(beta, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break  # alpha cutoff
        return min_eval


Evaluation Function Details:

The evaluation function considers the following factors:

    1. Material count: Standard piece values (Pawn=1, Knight/Bishop=3, Rook=5, Queen=9)

    2. Positional bonuses: Central control and development

    3. King safety: Penalizes exposed king positions

Example formula:

    score = material_score(position) + positional_bonus(position) - king_exposure_penalty  (position)

UI Design (Console-Based Chessboard):

The chessboard UI updates in real time and uses Unicode characters to represent pieces.

Example Output:

    8 -R -N -B -Q -K -B -N -R
    7 -P -P -P -P -P -P -P -P

## Overview

**MACE** stands for **Modern Algorithm Chess Engine** (prototype), developed by Ishan A.  
This is a prototype chess engine written in C++ that demonstrates basic chess AI concepts, including move generation, board evaluation, and a simple search algorithm.  
The engine is designed for educational and experimental purposes and is not open source.

---

## Features

- **Custom Chess Engine:** Implements its own board representation and move logic.
- **AI Opponent:** The computer always plays as Black; the user plays as White.
- **Move Generator:** Generates all possible moves for both human and computer.
- **Simple Evaluation:** Evaluates board state based on material, development, and pawn advancement.
- **Text-Based Interface:** Runs in the terminal with ASCII board display.
- **Help System:** Type `?` for help on commands and piece notation.
- **Restart and Exit:** Type `n` to start a new game, `x` to exit.

---

## Code Structure

### Main Components

- **Board Representation:**  
  `int Board[12][12];`  
  Uses a 12x12 array for easy boundary checking (actual board is 8x8, surrounded by a border).

- **Move Generation:**  
  Functions like `HumanMoveGenerator`, `ComputerMoveGenerator`, and their helpers generate all legal moves for each side.

- **Evaluation:**  
  The `Evaluation()` function scores the board based on material, development, and pawn advancement.

- **Search:**  
  The engine uses a simple recursive search to select the best move for the computer.

- **Game Loop:**  
  The `main()` function handles user input, move validation, and alternates between human and computer moves.

### Key Functions

- `NewGame()`: Initializes the board to the starting position.
- `PrintBoard()`: Displays the current board in the terminal.
- `PrintHelp()`: Shows help and piece notation.
- `MakeMovement()` / `UnMakeMovement()`: Executes and undoes moves.
- `AllComputerMoves()` / `AllHumanMoves()`: Generates all possible moves for each side.
- `StartSearch()`: Begins the computer's move search.
- `Evaluation()`: Evaluates the board for the search algorithm.

---

## Optimizations & Suggestions

- **Move Validation:**  
  Currently, the engine does not check for all chess rules (e.g., castling, en passant, check/checkmate).
- **Search Depth:**  
  The search depth is fixed at 5; increasing it will make the engine stronger but slower.
- **Evaluation Function:**  
  The evaluation is basic; adding more positional factors can improve play.
- **User Interface:**  
  A graphical interface or web version could make the engine more user-friendly.
- **Code Modernization:**  
  Refactoring to use modern C++ features and removing `goto` would improve maintainability.


## In-Depth Documentation: Move Evaluation and Game Evaluation Functions

This section explains the core evaluation logic in `main1.cpp` for the MACE chess engine. These functions determine how the engine assesses the board and chooses moves.

---

### 1. `int Evaluation()`

**Purpose:**  
Calculates a numeric score for the current board position, combining material, development, pawn advancement, and piece proximity to objectives. The evaluation adapts based on the game phase (opening, middlegame, endgame).

**How it works:**  
- Calls `GameState()` to determine the phase of the game.
- In the **opening** (`State==1`):  
  `Evaluation = Material() + Development()`
- In the **middlegame** (`State==2`):  
  `Evaluation = Material() + Development() + HumanAproach(6,8) - ComputerAproach(6,3)`
- In the **endgame** (`State==3`):  
  Finds both kings' coordinates, then:  
  `Evaluation = Material() + Development() + PossibleCrown() + HumanAproach(XCK, YCK) - ComputerAproach(XHK, YHK)`

**Interpretation:**  
- Higher values favor the computer (Black), lower values favor the human (White).
- The function is called recursively during the search to compare possible future positions.

---

### 2. `int GameState()`

**Purpose:**  
Determines the current phase of the game: opening, middlegame, or endgame.

**How it works:**  
- If `MoveNo < 12`: **Opening** (`returns 1`)
- If `MoveNo > 30`: **Endgame** (`returns 3`)
- Otherwise: **Middlegame** (`returns 2`)

**Why:**  
Different evaluation criteria are more important in different phases (e.g., development in the opening, king safety in the endgame).

---

### 3. `int Material()`

**Purpose:**  
Calculates the total material value on the board.

**How it works:**  
- Sums the values of all pieces on the board using their integer codes (positive for computer, negative for human).
- Returns the net material balance.

**Why:**  
Material advantage is a fundamental factor in chess evaluation.

---

### 4. `int Development()`

**Purpose:**  
Rewards or penalizes piece development, especially in the opening.

**How it works:**  
- Adds points for computer pawns advanced to the 6th rank.
- Adds points if certain squares in the back rank are empty (indicating pieces have moved).
- Penalizes if human pieces are still on their back rank.
- Adds or subtracts points for pawns in the center.

**Why:**  
Encourages the engine to develop pieces and control the center early in the game.

---

### 5. `int PossibleCrown()`

**Purpose:**  
Rewards pawns that are close to promotion.

**How it works:**  
- For each computer pawn on the 3rd, 4th, or 5th rank, adds 15, 10, or 5 points, respectively.
- For each human pawn on the 8th, 7th, or 6th rank, subtracts 15, 10, or 5 points, respectively.

**Why:**  
Promoting a pawn is a major advantage, so the engine is encouraged to advance pawns.

---

### 6. `int HumanAproach(int X2, int Y2)`  
### 7. `int ComputerAproach(int X2, int Y2)`

**Purpose:**  
Measures how close pieces are to a target square (usually the enemy king or a promotion square).

**How it works:**  
- For each relevant piece, calculates the Euclidean distance to the target square.
- In the endgame, the king's distance is weighted more heavily.
- Sums the distances for all pieces.

---

### 8. `void KingCoordinates(int &XCK, int &YCK, int &XHK, int &YHK)`

**Purpose:**  
Finds the coordinates of both kings on the board.

**How it works:**  
- Scans the board for the computer king (`King`) and the human king (`-King`).
- Sets the reference variables to their positions.

**Why:**  
Used by the evaluation functions to assess king safety and proximity.

## Notes

- The evaluation is **basic** and does not account for all chess subtleties (e.g., king safety, mobility, threats).
- The engine does **not** currently check for check, checkmate, or castling.
- The evaluation is designed for speed and simplicity, suitable for a prototype engine.

---

**Note:**  
This is a prototype and a phase one beta model. Castling, checks, and checkmates are not yet implemented. Await further improvements
